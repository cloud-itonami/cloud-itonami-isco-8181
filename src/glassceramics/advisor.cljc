  "Glass and Ceramics Plant Coordination Advisor — proposing a glass/
  ceramics plant scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a
  work record, schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern,
  coordinate a raw-material/refractory-materials supply order) from a
  crew roster, plant registration and safety-reporting policy.
  Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes —
  `glassceramics.governor` independently gates every proposal and
  always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold supply orders.
  The advisor never proposes to directly finalize a
  plant-operation-execution decision (e.g. deciding to run or proceed
  with a specific glass-melting furnace or ceramics kiln cycle) or a
  plant-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring the plant floor
  safety-cleared), and never proposes to override a plant safety
  officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this actor's
  scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8114's
  mineralplant.advisor for the industrial-plant-safety-domain shape.
